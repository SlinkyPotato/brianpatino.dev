DEGEN is a POAP distribution bot that lives on Discord. 
It began out of a need from BanklessDAO where hundreds of 
users attended voice calls and stages trying to learn all 
things web3.

It started as a simple script on BanklessDAO helping hundreds
of participants get their POAPs. This bot quickly grew and 
now distributes thousands of POAPs across over a hundred 
communities.
