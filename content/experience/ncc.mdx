### Database Administrator
Design and developed a database solution for the
management of Norwalk Community College's Connecticut
Collegiate Awareness and Preparation program (ConnCAP).
The main tool used is Microsoft Access with a strong
emphasis on relational database structure.

ConnCAP provides high school students in their freshman
to senior years the support they need to succeed in class
and future endeavors. They are guided to achieve higher
grades and build college ready skills.

### Math Tutor/Teacher
ConnCAP students commit to a four-year college pathway
program that builds academic skills and develops college
awareness through preparation activities. Participants
attend annual 6-week on-campus summer courses that include
academic subject reviews, trips, and activities. During the
school year, students participate in Saturday ConnCAP, a weekly
tutoring and learning program that transitions to taking college
level courses in junior and senior years of high school. 

To be eligible for ConnCAP, prospective participants must meet
income, citizenship, and academic criteria. In addition, they must
be potentially the first in their families to attend a four-year
college. - See more at: http://www.ncc.commnet.edu/news.asp?574#sthash.aIWxf1ti.dpuf
