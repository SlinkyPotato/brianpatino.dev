The Direct Connect Gateway team received daily
DCG transactions emails for some of the existing
partners. Reports were created using Microsoft
Excel to assist various teams. The objective of
the project is to enhance report creation by
consolidating reports across all partners, and
making it more user friendly. 

A Java RESTful web service was built using
Bootstrap and DataTables for the front-end and
a Java server for the back-end. The application
automatically retrieves transactions from the
database and display the results in a beautifully
styled table.
